            <li>
                Help Save Lives <br>
                <div class="content">
                It takes just one person to save 200 animals per year. Animal lives are lives too. <br>
                The most efficient way of becoming part of the solution is to eat plant-based foods.

            <li>
                Become Healthier
                <div class="content">
                    The Academy of Nutrition states that vegans are less likely to develop diabetes,<br>
                    cancer, heart disease and high blood pressure. Vegans are also on-average 20- <br>
                    pounds lighter than meat eaters are.

            </li>
            <li>
                Help Feed Others
                <div class="content">
                    Eating meat hurts others around the world just as much as it hurts people. It takes <br>
                    up to 13lbs of grain to produce 1 pound of animal flesh! If humans ate that food <br>
                    directly, it could help solve world hunger across the globe! <br>

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Save the Planet
                <div class="content">
                    A plant based diet is very environmentally friendly. Meat production causes lots <br>
                    of pollution and is very wasteful. Adopting a vegan diet is more helpful to the <br>
                    environment than switching to a more fuel efficient car! <br>

                    Lots of popular celebrities have started a plant based diet, some of which include: <br>
                    Joaquin Phoenix, Natalie Portman, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilliesh, Alicia Silverstone, <br>
                    Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson and Carrie Underwood! <br>
